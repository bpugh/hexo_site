After having just watched one Rob Conery's excellent screencasts at Tekpub on going from Coder to Developer, I've finally decided to start my own blog. Rob suggested possibly making it something of a development journal if you're learning a new language or technology and being relatively new to the industry and being a lead developer, it feels like I'm learning so much so fast. So this is my outlet for recording/sharing my experiences, knowledge, trials, triumphs, and mistakes with anyone who might find it interesting or useful.
