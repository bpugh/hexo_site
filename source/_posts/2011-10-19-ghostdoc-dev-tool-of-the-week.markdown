Thought I would try to make it a thing where I post about a particular tool I'm using that makes life easier for me as a developer.

[GhostDoc](http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx) is a cool little Visual Studio plugin that makes commenting your methods and properties much easier. With a keyboard shortcut or right clicking on a method name, GhostDoc will automatically generate xml documentation comments by intelligently looking at the method name and parameters:

I know how we can all get lazy when it comes to documenting our code especially when we're on a time crunch but I've definitely found GhostDoc helps minimize a bit of the friction when it comes to writing documentation comments and your team members will definitely thank you for it.
